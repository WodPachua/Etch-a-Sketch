# Etch-a-Sketch
This is part of the Odin Project Curriculum to understand more about DOM manipulation skills with JavaScript. 

This is a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

## How it works
- To activate the sketch grids, click any where on the sketch pad. 
- Move your mouse around the Pad to make your sketch.
- The default grid is 16 x 16. You can change this by clicking the "Enter Grid Length" and you will be asked to enter the grids you want per row and column. This should be between 1 and 100.
- You can clear your pad with the "Clear" button.
Enjoy!!!
