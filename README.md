# Etch-a-Sketch
This is part of the Odin Project Curriculum to understand more about DOM manipulation skills with JavaScript. 

This is a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

## How it works
- To activate the sketch grids, click any where on the sketch pad. 
- Move your mouse around the Pad to make your sketch.
- The default grid is 16 x 16. You can change this by clicking the "Enter Grid Length" and you will be asked to enter the grids you want per row and column. This should be between 1 and 100.
- You can clear your pad with the "Clear" button.
Enjoy!!!

# NEW!!!
- You can now change the color of your sketch from the default rainbow color to any color of choice using the color picker, or revert back to the default with just a click. Cool, right!!
